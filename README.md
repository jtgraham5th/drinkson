# drinkson

Drinkson is a mobile application that gives the user the choice of ordering a drink instead of standing in line for a bartender.  This application will give the user the ability to send a drinl or share a drink with a user in the same bar as them. As you can see with this iteration of the Beverly, you can order drinks from the menu.  We want to allow the user to basically create a drink from scratch if they desire.
